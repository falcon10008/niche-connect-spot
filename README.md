# Niche Connect Spot

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a platform designed to connect brands and creators, potentially focusing on niche areas.  Based on the file structure, it leverages modern web technologies to provide a user-friendly interface for building partnerships. The title in `index.html` suggests a focus on effortless connections between brands and creators. The `lovable.dev` URL in the original README suggests a rapid development and deployment environment.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Creator Discovery:**  Likely allows brands to search and find creators that align with their specific niche or target audience.
*   **Partnership Building:** Facilitates direct communication and collaboration between brands and creators.
*   **Streamlined Workflow:** Aims to simplify the process of establishing and managing partnerships.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React and a component library (potentially Shadcn UI), suggesting a focus on a modern and intuitive experience.
*   **Efficient Development:** Leveraging tools like Vite, TypeScript, and ESLint indicates a commitment to code quality and development speed.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (Version 18 or higher recommended) - JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **npm** or **bun:** (npm comes with Node.js) - Package manager. bun is apparent from `bun.lockb`.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/falcon10008/niche-connect-spot.git
    cd niche-connect-spot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using bun (recommended):**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

    *Or, if you prefer npm:*

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configuration (if applicable):**

    *   Check for any required environment variables or configuration files (none explicitly defined in the file list). If present, configure them accordingly.

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
   *Or with npm:*
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

    This will typically start the application at `http://localhost:3000` or similar.  Check the console output for the exact URL.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Currently, API documentation is not provided. The best way to understand the usage of individual components and API endpoints would be to inspect the source code, particularly the `src/App.tsx` file and any related modules.

## Configuration Options

While specific configuration options aren't readily apparent from the provided files, the `vite.config.js` file (not included but generally present in Vite projects) often contains settings for:

*   **Port:** Changing the default port for the development server.
*   **Proxy:**  Setting up proxy rules for API requests.
*   **Environment Variables:** Defining environment-specific settings (e.g., API keys).
